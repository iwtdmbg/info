                        I want to die!!! A server where depressed and suicidal individuals meets their final destination! You get the concept, this server is satire. It all started when I had nothing to do. I asked my friends if they wanna host a server, they agreed to help. I did not know what name should I give, so I decided to asked my friends again, then blaow! I want to die was made! This server was a huge joke, so many controversies had happened in it. Conceivably, if you wanna join, we are more than welcome to have you!

It looked like it was about to so I had to calculate the circumference of the universe and since we know that my favorite color is triangle, I calculated that the yellow stop sign would begin falling at the speed of 8 Rick Rolls per second. I had to think at the speed of sound so I could feed the slow sign to my car and-ow! The go sign went right over me without even touching me.

                            When it was founded in April 26, 2022, nothing much happened, the server was slowly growing, then it entered an abrupt stalemate which lasted for a month, it was a pain to advertise during that time since everybody thought it was too satire, no afterthoughts, you literally cant persuade anybody to join. Everything was calm and chill, until the #Beat-the-shit-outta-everyone Channel was made.

                            #Beat-the-shit-outta-everyone - a channel made for roasting people for fun. It was originally Fear Shroom's idea to make this channel if the server reaches 20 members. She never made the channel, except ラマオく did. He made the channel for no reason whatsoever, that was when things would fall down and crumble.

Honestly, i named it that way since i thought it was gonna be another satirical mess. At first, i didn't take it seriously, i know its only gonna last for a month. Nothing much was going on, everything was dry, until one fateful day.

I was... uhhh... asleep.... when they were all doing this shit... so I'm fucking unaware LMAO. I was annoyed too since Half-Asleep Inc was by far my most favorite server. Everything was all back to normal, Brought back an old memory, restored a friendship, and most importantly, I want to die...

                            ERT is the oldest sub-community in IWTD, even older than IWTD itself. It was a pretty active community but it became inactive just after a few months of foundation, so I, the founder, decided to transfer the entire community into IWTD since this is the most successful community I've managed. ERT is basically bootleg Earth, where people gather and socialize.

                            ERT started because LiamTHT got addicted to countryballs and asked ラマオく to make a server based on it. All that was on his mind was Earth so he decided to make a bootleg version of it and called it "ERT", Voxil(nolmfao) and Duckyy was invited after a while and these four became the Team ERT. Team ERT turned from being a community for countryballs into a community for humans overall, but it became inactive and was transferred into I want to die as a sub-community/faction.
