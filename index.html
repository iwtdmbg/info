                        I want to die, this is a community where depressed people meets their final destination. It is owned by Fear Shroom, and its also co-owned by 2 psychotic Self-Murderers. This all started as a joke between friends, then it became a discord server, then it became what it is now, a very, very fucking small community, with less than 20 members, and more than 3/4 of those people are inactive due to everyone beeing busy or being in a different timezone. So it is hard to keep the server alive when most are inactive, that's exactly why we need more people, especially active ones. Having more active people can keep the server alive, making it more fun. Just as they say, "The more, the merrier!"
